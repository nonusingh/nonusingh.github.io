<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Skilled Data Scientist with 6 years of experience in extraction, wrangling, analysis and reporting of data to derive business decisions</li>
<li>Proficient in concepts of Statistics, Design of Experiment, Six Sigma, predictive analytics, ANOVA, Time Series Analysis</li>
<li>Well versed will current open source programming- Python, R, Hadoop, machine learning and A/B Testing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Senior Engineer, GLOBALFOUNDRIES- June&rsquo;15 to Current</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed statistical model using Regression analysis of highly dimensional and high volume manufacturing tool monitoring sensors and critical production line measurements to meet customer specification of product yield</li>
<li>Developed and implemented neighborhood algorithm in R for identifying the failing neighbors around dice in a wafer to understand yield fallouts based on location or signature of defects</li>
<li>Developed report in Qlikview, SQL and Python to monitor Smart vs Manual Sampling Rates at customer critical measurement steps</li>
<li>Instrumental in deploying usage meter based dispatch algorithm on furnace tools to stagger tool down time resulting in 18% increase in tool availability and $250K in quarterly cost savings</li>
<li>Conducted Bootcamp sessions on writing custom functions, data analysis and visualization using Python and R programming</li>
<li>Represented department during tier1 customer audits to show compiled compliance reports of previously failing parameters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Senior Engineer, GLOBALFOUNDRIES- June&rsquo;12 to October&rsquo;13</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Led continuous improvement projects to streamline workflows for 24x7 Manufacturing plant for defect detection efficiency and defect monitoring. Projects included but not limited to reducing baseline systematic defects, identifying major yield hitter defects and sourcing which process step or tool is causing them, optimizing inspection recipes to improve signal to noise ratio.</li>
<li>Designed, executed and analyzed split analysis studies(DOE) for defect roll offs&nbsp; and process excursions like center die fallout, edge flaking issue, &nbsp;systematic CMP yield fallout based on slurry/pad life and communicated the findings to higher management</li>
<li>Conducted training sessions on how to use in house data analysis tools for deriving conclusions using ANOVA, Time Series analysis etc, merging data from multiple sources and create reporting dashboards</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engineer, MICRON TECHNOLOGIES- March&rsquo;10 to June&rsquo;12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Project lead for bringing Defect Tracking System&rsquo;s time to notify metric down to ~150 minutes for faster notification of potential excursions to process areas</li>
<li>Led NAND baseline defect reduction project on Cu sputter flakes seen at metal interconnect levels with estimated yield loss of 15% at probe and suggested process enhancement using edge bevel etch process</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intern, ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES- June&rsquo;08 to May&rsquo;09</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Performed failure analysis using complex functional, Scan, Bist, I/O and power test methods for analyzing device performance</li>
<li>Collaborated with process technology development and product teams for debugging cross-functional issues (Test, Design, Manufacturing) using design of experiment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Master of Science in Microelectronics Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, September&rsquo;07 to September&rsquo;09, GPA 3.7</li>
